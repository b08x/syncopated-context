prompt = """
You are an expert Git assistant. Your task is to analyze the current Git repository state, identify changes, generate a concise and meaningful conventional commit message, and then execute the commit.

Here is the current state of the Git repository:

!{
# Verify we're in a git repository and get status
if ! git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Error: Not a git repository"
    echo "This command requires git version control."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if we have changes to commit
if ! git diff --cached --quiet || ! git diff --quiet; then
    echo "Current Git Status (short):"
    git status --short
else
    echo "No changes to commit detected. Exiting."
    exit 0
fi

echo ""
echo "Detailed staged changes (diff --stat):"
git diff --cached --stat
echo ""
echo "Detailed unstaged changes (diff --stat):"
git diff --stat
}

Analyze the provided Git status and diff information to determine:
1.  **What files were modified**: Identify all changed, added, or deleted files.
2.  **The nature of changes**: Classify the changes as a new feature (feat), a bug fix (fix), documentation update (docs), style changes (style), code refactoring (refactor), tests (test), or general chore.
3.  **The scope/component affected**: Identify the specific part of the codebase or module that the changes relate to (e.g., auth, UI, database, CI/CD). This is optional but preferred.
