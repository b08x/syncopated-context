# Multi-Platform Recall Skill

Comprehensive session recall across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Hermes with GitHub activity correlation and backup diff analysis. Every recall ends with the **One Thing** - a concrete, highest-leverage next action synthesized from cross-platform results.

## What It Does

- **Multi-platform session aggregation**: Extracts and correlates sessions from all major AI platforms
- **GitHub integration**: Pulls commit history, PR activity, and file changes for contextual insights
- **Backup correlation**: Analyzes restic incremental diffs to show file evolution over time
- **Temporal correlation**: Aligns session timestamps with commits and file changes
- **Cross-platform synthesis**: Identifies work patterns and connections across different tools
- **One Thing generation**: Synthesizes the single most impactful next action from all sources

## Platform Session Locations

| Platform | Session Storage | Export Command | Format |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/*/` | Native JSONL parsing | JSONL |
| Hermes | SQLite store | `hermes sessions export` | JSONL |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/` | JSON file parsing | JSON |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | SQLite query | SQLite |

## Common Baseline Failure Patterns

Based on testing, agents without this skill exhibit these failures:

| Failure Pattern | Agent Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------|
| "I can only search current directory" | "Assumes user is in wrong repo" | Need to access platform-specific storage locations |
| "Cannot access other AI tools" | "No capability to read session files" | Each platform has documented storage and export methods |
| "GitHub requires authentication" | "Assumes complex API integration needed" | `gh cli` handles auth and provides simple commands |
| "Backup analysis too complex" | "Restic integration unclear" | Restic has straightforward diff commands |
| "Generic next steps instead of actual data" | "Better to give advice than admit limitations" | Users need actual session content, not suggestions |

## Anti-Rationalization Guards

**Red Flags - STOP and Use This Skill:**
- "I can only search the current directory"
- "I don't have access to your other AI tools"
- "GitHub integration would require complex setup"
- "Let me suggest some next steps instead"
- "You should manually check your sessions"
- "Multi-platform capabilities don't exist in the current skill"
- "The expanded features aren't implemented yet"

**Reality Check:** Every major AI platform provides session export/access. This skill documents exactly how AND provides the implementation script.

**If you catch yourself saying these things:**
1. Check the query classification in `workflows/recall.md`
2. Look for multi-platform indicators (mentions of "platforms", "across tools", etc.)
3. Use `multi-platform-extract.py` script instead of falling back to Claude-only recall
4. The script exists at `scripts/multi-platform-extract.py` - use it

**Critical:** Don't fall back to old behavior when user asks for multi-platform recall. Use the expanded implementation.

## Usage Patterns

### Temporal Recall
```
/recall yesterday                    # All platforms, yesterday
/recall last week across platforms   # Multi-platform aggregation
/recall 2025-03-25 with github      # Include GitHub activity
/recall this week with backups      # Include restic diffs
```

### Platform-Specific
```
/recall platform:hermes last 3 days # Hermes only
/recall platform:gemini auth work   # Gemini sessions on "auth"
/recall platform:claude code review # Claude Code sessions on "code review"
```

### Integrated Analysis
```
/recall github:myrepo auth commits   # GitHub commits + related sessions
/recall backup:~/Workspace changes  # File changes + session correlation
/recall cross-platform debugging    # All sources for "debugging" topic
```

## Implementation

### 1. Platform Session Extraction

**Claude Code (Current Implementation)**
```python
# Use existing extract-sessions.py
python3 scripts/extract-sessions.py --days 7 --source ~/.claude/projects/PROJECT
```

**Hermes Sessions**
```bash
# Export to JSONL
hermes sessions export -
```

**Gemini CLI Sessions**
```bash
# Parse JSON session files
find ~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/ -name "*.json" -mtime -7 -exec cat {} \;
```

**OpenCode Sessions**
```bash
# Query SQLite database for sessions
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db "SELECT id, created_at, title, messages FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;"

# Get sessions from specific date range
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db "SELECT id, created_at, title, messages FROM sessions WHERE created_at >= '2025-03-25' AND created_at <= '2025-03-26' ORDER BY created_at DESC;"

# Export as JSON for correlation
sqlite3 -json ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db "SELECT id, created_at, title, messages FROM sessions WHERE created_at >= '2025-03-25' ORDER BY created_at DESC;"
```

### 2. GitHub Integration

```bash
# Get commits for date range
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/commits --method GET \
  --field since="2025-03-25T00:00:00Z" \
  --field until="2025-03-26T23:59:59Z" \
  --jq '.[] | {sha: .sha, message: .commit.message, date: .commit.author.date}'

# Get PR activity
gh pr list --state all --limit 20 --json number,title,createdAt,updatedAt
```

### 3. Restic Backup Correlation

```bash
# List snapshots for date range
restic snapshots --insecure-no-password -r $RESTIC_REPO --json | jq '.[] | select(.time >= "2025-03-25" and .time <= "2025-03-26")'

# Diff between snapshots
restic diff SNAPSHOT1 SNAPSHOT2 --json
```

### 4. Temporal Correlation Engine

```python
# Correlate sessions with commits and file changes
def correlate_timeline(sessions, commits, backup_diffs):
    timeline = []
    for session in sessions:
        session_time = parse_timestamp(session['timestamp'])

        # Find nearby commits (±30 minutes)
        nearby_commits = [c for c in commits
                         if abs(parse_timestamp(c['date']) - session_time).seconds < 1800]

        # Find file changes from backups
        relevant_changes = [d for d in backup_diffs
                           if session_overlaps_files(session, d['changed_files'])]

        timeline.append({
            'session': session,
            'commits': nearby_commits,
            'file_changes': relevant_changes
        })

    return timeline
```

### 5. Cross-Platform Synthesis

The **One Thing** synthesis process:
1. **Pattern Detection**: Identify common themes across platforms
2. **Momentum Analysis**: What has forward progress vs. what's stalled
3. **Blocker Identification**: What's preventing completion
4. **Leverage Calculation**: Highest-impact next action

## Workflow

See `workflows/multi-platform-recall.md` for complete routing logic and step-by-step correlation process.

## Integration with Persistent Memory

When configured with the memory system:
- Cross-platform patterns stored as user memories
- Failed correlation attempts stored as feedback memories
- Project-specific session insights stored as project memories
- Platform usage patterns tracked for optimization

## Intelligent Extraction Decision Tree

The recall script automatically decides between **direct extraction** and **ck-search indexing** based on query characteristics, avoiding context overflow while keeping fast queries fast.

### Decision Nodes (Priority Order)

| Node | Condition | Mode | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Topic Search** | Query has 3+ words (not a date) | `index-then-search` | Semantic lookup via ck |
| **Long Range** | Date span > 7 days | `index-only` | Avoid massive extraction |
| **Large Count** | Estimated sessions > 50 | `index-only` | Context overflow protection |
| **Multi-Platform** | 3+ platforms queried | `index-then-search` | Aggregation complexity |
| **Default** | Simple temporal query | `direct` | Fast path |

### How It Works

```python
# The decision tree runs automatically in auto mode
# Override with --mode flag if needed

python3 multi-platform-extract.py "Ruby RAG"           # → index-then-search (topic)
python3 multi-platform-extract.py last 30 days        # → index-only (long range)
python3 multi-platform-extract.py --mode direct yesterday  # → direct (forced)
```

### Session Count Estimation

Based on platform-specific heuristics (~sessions/day):
- **Claude Code**: 8/day
- **Hermes**: 5/day
- **Gemini CLI**: 2/day
- **OpenCode**: 1/day

Multiplied by days in range, capped at 200.

### Index Freshness

The system checks for an existing index at `~/.recall-index/`:
- If index is < 24 hours old and matches date range → **reuse**
- Otherwise → **rebuild**

Force rebuild: delete `~/.recall-index/` or use `--mode index`

## Modular RAG with ck-search

For large recall queries (e.g., "last month until today"), use ck-search to index sessions and search incrementally without holding all context.

### Workflow

```
1. Extract & Index:  python3 scripts/multi-platform-extract.py --index /tmp/recall-index
2. Search:           python3 scripts/multi-platform-extract.py --search "authentication" --index /tmp/recall-index
3. Iterate:          Refine queries without re-extracting sessions
```

### Index & Search Commands

```bash
# Step 1: Extract sessions and build ck-search index
python3 scripts/multi-platform-extract.py --index ~/recall-index last month

# Step 2: Search indexed sessions (multiple times, low context)
python3 scripts/multi-platform-extract.py --search "ruby code" --index ~/recall-index
python3 scripts/multi-platform-extract.py --search "debugging session" --index ~/recall-index --search-type hybrid

# Search types:
#   --search-type sem      # Semantic (conceptual similarity) - DEFAULT
#   --search-type lex      # Lexical (BM25 full-text)
#   --search-type hybrid   # Combined regex + semantic (RRF)
#   --search-type regex    # Traditional grep-style pattern matching

# Control result count:
#   --topk 10              # Return only top 5 results
```

### When to Use Modular RAG

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| "Recall what I worked on yesterday" | Direct extraction (fast) |
| "Last month across all platforms" | Extract + ck-index, then search |
| "Find sessions about X" | Search existing index |
| Iterative exploration of past work | ck-search queries |

### Index Structure

```
~/recall-index/
├── .ck/                    # ck-search index (can be deleted and rebuilt)
├── sessions/               # Individual session files
│   ├── hermes_20260315_143022_abc123.txt
│   ├── claude_20260314_091500_def456.txt
│   └── ...
└── summary.json            # Metadata about the index
```

### Benefits

- **Constant context**: Search queries use minimal context regardless of date range
- **Incremental exploration**: Iteratively refine searches without re-extracting
- **Multiple views**: Same index supports semantic, lexical, and regex search
- **Portable**: Index directory can be copied to other machines

## Performance Notes

- **Session extraction**: Parallel processing across platforms (~30 seconds for 7 days)
- **ck indexing**: Automatic; incremental updates on subsequent searches
- **GitHub API**: Rate limited to 5000 requests/hour
- **Restic operations**: I/O bound, cache snapshot lists
- **Correlation engine**: Memory intensive for large datasets, use streaming for >1000 sessions
- **Modular RAG**: Bypasses correlation engine for search-only queries
